# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Rail Fence cipher visualization web tool (レールフェンス暗号の仕組みを視覚的に学べるWebツール). The project appears to be in early development stage with only basic repository structure set up.

## Repository Structure

The repository currently has minimal structure:
- `assets/` directory (empty)
- MIT license
- Basic .gitignore configured for Claude, VSCode, macOS, and temporary files

## Development Status

This is a new project with initial repository setup. The implementation of the Rail Fence cipher visualization tool has not yet been created. When developing:

1. The tool should provide visual learning for Rail Fence cipher encryption/decryption
2. Consider creating an interactive web interface (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
3. The `assets/` directory is available for storing static resources

## Notes

- The project uses `.nojekyll` file, suggesting intention for GitHub Pages deployment
- Japanese documentation in README indicates the target audience may be Japanese speakers
